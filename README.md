## GAM-NICHE

Welcome! 

This is a short tutorial for constructing species distribution models in R using Shape-Constrained Generalized Additive Models, based on the development and application to marine fish by [Citores et al. 2020 Ecological Modelling 418:108926](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108926).

The code is available in [AZTI's github repository](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/gam-niche) and the book is readily available [here](https://fundacion-azti.github.io/gam-niche/).
