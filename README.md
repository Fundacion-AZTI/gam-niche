## GAM-NICHE

Welcome! 

This is a short tutorial for constructing species distribution models in R using shape-constrained generalized additive models, based on the development and application to marine fish by @citores_etal_2020.

The code is available in [AZTI's github repository](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/gam-niche) and the book is readily available [here](https://fundacion-azti.github.io/gam-niche/).
