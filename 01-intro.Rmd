# Introduction

Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance at known locations with information on the environmental and/or spatial characteristics of those locations [@elith_etal_2009]. They are also known as ecological niche models (ENM) or habitat suitability models or... 

A wide variety of methods have been used ... 

Reviews of SDM literature include ... 

One of the common problems is that, the fitted models do not agree with the ecological niche theory...  

This book provides a tutorial on how to use shape-constrained generalized additive models to build SDMs. It is organised following the key steps in good modeling practice of SDMs [@elith_etal_2009]. First, presence data of a selected species are downloaded from GBIF/OBIS datasets and pseudo-absence data are created. Then, environmental data are downloaded from public repositories and extracted at each of the presence/pseudo-absence data points. Based on this dataset, an exploratory analysis is conducted to help deciding on the best modelling approach. The model is fitted to the dataset and the quality of the fit and the realism of the fitted response function are evaluated. After selecting a threshold to transform the continuous probability predictions into binary responses, the model is validated using a k-fold approach. Finally, the predicted maps are generated for visualization.
