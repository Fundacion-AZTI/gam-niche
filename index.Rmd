# About {-}

This is a short tutorial for constructing species distribution models in R using shape-constrained generalized additive models, based on the development and application to marine fish by [Citores et al. 2020 Ecological Modelling 418:108926. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108926](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/gam-niche)[@citores_etal_2020]

The code is available in [AZTI's github repository](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/gam-niche) and the book is readily available [here](https://fundacion-azti.github.io/gam-niche/).
